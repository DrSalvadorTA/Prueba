# Interactive PID Controller Tuning Tool

This project is an interactive web application built with Streamlit for tuning and comparing PID controllers for first and second-order systems. It provides a comprehensive dashboard for performance analysis and visualization.

## üöÄ Features

-   **Interactive System Modeling:** Define first or second-order transfer functions by adjusting parameters like gain, time constant, dead time, natural frequency, and damping ratio.
-   **Multiple Tuning Rules:** Apply industry-standard PID tuning rules to your system model:
    -   Ziegler-Nichols (Open-Loop & Closed-Loop)
    -   Cohen-Coon
    -   IMC (Internal Model Control)
-   **Comprehensive Performance Analysis:** Instantly view key performance metrics for your tuned controller, including:
    -   Time-domain characteristics (Overshoot, Settling Time, Rise Time)
    -   Integral error criteria (IAE, ISE, ITAE, ITSE)
    -   Frequency-domain stability margins (Gain Margin, Phase Margin)
-   **Rich Visualizations:**
    -   Interactive Step Response plot (via Plotly)
    -   Bode plot
    -   Nyquist diagram
-   **Real-Time Interactivity:** All metrics and plots update instantly as you adjust parameters, providing immediate feedback.
-   **Data Export:** Download calculated metrics as a CSV file or export plots as PNG images.
